# COMPUTER NETWORKS
Department Network

# DEVICES USED:
•	60 Generic Computers
•	12 Switches (2960)
•	4 Routers (2911)
•	2 Generic Servers

# STRUCTURE:
The network topology consists of three departments (cyber security, artificial intelligence, and computer science). Each department consists of a Lab, Faculty Office, and Classrooms. The Labs actually have more than 20 computers but as this project is a model of the actual network so I have used only six computers per lab, similarly faculty offices consist of eight computers and each department has six classrooms. Labs have two switches, the Faculty office has one, and the six classes are connected with a single switch.
